I'd like to implement support for getting provider secrets from external sources, including environment variables (by name) and 1Password (by op:// reference).  I have my own 1password package at @teamsparkai/1password that I'd like to use to access 1Password.  If either of the 1Password environment vars are present when an agent is started, then we should enable 1password support.  We should load env vars from the cwd (as I think we do now) and the agent directory.  In the provider config for fields that are marked secret, I want a picker that allows me to select between value, env var, and 1password.  When 1password is selected I want a button to bring up a modal browser/picker that lets me browse vaults and items and pick a field, returning a op:// reference to that field, which we will display and store as the value.  At runtime when the secrets are accessed, we will need logic to get the secret from the appropriate secret manager.  Maybe they should be modular (have one for val, env var, and 1passsord for now).  We will need to store the secret type somehow (either implicit in the value, such as op:// for 1password, env:// for env var) or maybe as a separate field.  I want you to create a design document to describe what we are trying to achieve and how we will achieve it, including a phased implementation plan.

First design: sent cdw and agentDir into all providers, env provider loaded its own env vars for resolution

I want the env var loading from cwd and the agent dir to be handled at the agent level using dotenv (I don't want the env secret provider to know about the details of loading the env vars - it should just use what's available in the process, which should be initialized as specified).  Likewise, it doesn't seem like we need cwd and agentDir in the secfretresolutiooncontext (and even if we did need agentDir, we would get it from the agent, not pass it as a param).
